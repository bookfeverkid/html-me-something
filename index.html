   <p> I have been to Universal Studios in Orlando several times in my life and it is always great. 
    They have several different rollercoaster and 3D rides which a fun.  hulk is one of my favorite coasters.  
    They are always adding new themed areas and rides to the park.  Harry Potter Land is one of  my favorite areas in the park, complete with its own set of rides, train and shops.
    Their newest edition to the park which is Star War land which should be neat.</p>

    <p>The Victoria Albert Museum locatedc in London is home to many diverse exibits.  
    Currently exibits can be found on their website and quite often they have exibits featuring clothing
    of the past which is a particular interest of mine.  However, the reason I most want to vist the VA Museum, is they house in their archives, 
    several piece of medieval knitting I would like to make appointments to see in person.</p>

    <p> The Library of Congress I visited on my last trip to Washington D.C.  
        The internal architecture and decoration of the building is wonderful. 
    They store copies of all books pulblished in the United State and possibly else where. 
    As a forever lover of books, I will always be overwhelmed by this place and the knowledge it holds.</p>
